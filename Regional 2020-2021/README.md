There was a regional Saint-Petersburg olympiad on 16th and 18th of January. 
This folder contains my submissions. </br>
I've got 800 points out of 800. It's amazing! 

Despite the fact this folder contains the solutions to all 8 problems, it doesn't show how did I found this awesome matrix for problem G. I forgot to save my brutforse solution. However, function `go` can explain something. I added some randomizations and happily get the matrix after 3 hours of brutforsing)
